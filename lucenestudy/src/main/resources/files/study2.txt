OPEN.
THE APACHE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION
provides support for the Apache Community of open-source software projects, which provide software products for the public good.

INNOVATION.
THE APACHE PROJECTS ARE DEFINED
by collaborative consensus based processes, an open, pragmatic software license and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field.

COMMUNITY.
WE CONSIDER OURSELVES
not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather a community of developers and users.

APACHE PROJECTS
The all-volunteer ASF develops, stewards, and incubates more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives that cover a wide range of technologies. From Abdera to Zookeeper, if you are looking for a rewarding experience in Open Source and industry leading software, chances are you are going to find it here. Are you powered by Apache?
